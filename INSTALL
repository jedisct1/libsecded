The library can be compiled on any supported system with Zig:

zig build -Drelease-safe

The resulting library can then be found in the zig-out/lib/ folder.

On Linux systems, "make" compiles libsecded, runs various tests in C,
and runs various tests against a simpler Python implementation of the
same functions.
